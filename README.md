# Code Refactor Starter Code
-I started off by mapping out the website on paper to locate where I should add Semantic tags.
-I tried to clean up/orgainze the html to try and follow a logical stucture.
-I then added the approproate semantic tags to the html.
-I added an appropriate title.
-I proceeded to fix the link to the "Search Engine Optimization"  part of the header.
-I added alt atributes to the images on html.
-I finished but doing any needed organzation of code and checking for any errors.
