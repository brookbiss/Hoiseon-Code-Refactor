# Code Refactor Starter Code
-I started off by mapping out the website on paper to locate where I should add Semantic tags and make notes for things to fix.
-I tried to clean up/orgainze the html to try and follow a logical stucture.
-I then added the appropriate semantic tags to the html, following the notes I mapped out on paper.
-I added a more appropriate title.
-I proceeded to fix the link to the "Search Engine Optimization" by adding an id.
-I added alt atributes to the images on html giving breif but helpful descriptions.
-I finished by doing any needed organzation of code and checking for any errors.
(Didn't have enough time to make a proper README)
